Just a few user scripts I've written to browse NSFW sites while retaining my
relative sanity.

These scripts are tested in Firefox 58 and Seamonkey 2.46. They should also work
in Chromium and Chrome, but I make no guarantees, since I almost never use those
browsers. If you find a problem with them, please report them on the 'issues'
tab, though.

The user script addons these are (currently) tested with include:
* Greasemonkey 3.9.0.1 (pre-WebExtensions)
* Greasemonkey 4.2 (WebExtensions)
* ViolentMonkey 2.8.28

I will not use TamperMonkey, as it is not open source software anymore, while
ViolentMonkey is and works in pretty much every browser TamperMonkey does. That
said, the last time I tried TamperMonkey they worked there, too.




All are licensed under the MIT license unless otherwise specified in the source
code itself. (As of the commit in which I authored this readme, there are no
exceptions - that is, all are MIT licensed).

To install a script, click the "raw" button on a script's source page. Note
that as of now, none of them will ever update automatically; if you use any of
these and something has broken, you will have to either come back here to check
if I've fixed the problem, or fix it yourself.

(If you fix a problem with my scripts, make them better quality, or anything
else, and you'd like to share, please don't hesitate to make a pull request
and/or a fork! Sharing is caring, etc.!)
